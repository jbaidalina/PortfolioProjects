The shots of the tree, either gently caressed by the artist's camera or exploding in a multitude of trembling and scratched forms, alternate with a series of shots of depressing new public-housing tower blocks. Lang revitalizes these buildings by clustering them together and/or blurring their contours. At a certain point, a building site appears; we see the buildings under construction, with construction workers busy at their task. Were these shots filmed later, or did the film-maker choose to show them later?

This panning movement continues, with a series of variations based on the geometric patterns offered by the half-broken windows: a series of backlit triangles and rectangles, which at times suggest an anthropomorphic motif.

What Klotz saw profoundly shocked him, as bodies littered the sides of the roads and bloody massacres became the order of the day. In between interviews with government officials and United Nations forces vainly struggling to contain the violence, Klotz captured the mayhem on film, believing that if world leaders saw what was happening, they would step forward to stop the violence. When Klotz was injured while filming an attack, he was sent back to Paris, and while his footage was aired, French forces only belatedly arrived, ultimately doing more to protect those who caused the massacre than bringing them to justice. Years later, Klotz used his footage to help identify some of the victims of the killings, and in 2006 he returned to Rwanda to visit the nation after the violence had ceased.",0.6,,2006-11-15,"Kigali, des images contre un massacre",False,0.0,0
